# Object Relationships + Some Git

### Git

1. Local Repository - A managed project on your machine, via git
2. `git add .` - a command that we use in order to stage files / folders for a commit
3. `git commit -m "commit message"` - This will create a save point for your repository
4. `git log` - shows our commit history
5. `git remote add origin <ssh url>` - This connects to a remote repository
6. `git push -u origin master` - pushes all changes to the remote repository, note -u stands for upstream which sets the default location to push. And only has to be used in the very beginning and then you can use `git push` after that.
